      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our team is made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds and skillsets, united by a shared passion for technology and a commitment to excellence. We have put our heads together to create two exciting simulators for Regal Rednox: an escape room type simulator and a 2D runner simulator. These simulators provide a realistic and engaging environment in which employees can practice identifying and responding to potential hazards.

         </p> <br><p>We take pride in our work and are committed to delivering a high-quality product that meets the unique needs of our clients. We understand the importance of safety in the workplace, and we are excited to be part of a project that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of Regal Rednox employees.
